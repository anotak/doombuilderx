// This is GZDB hints configuration file. It's dev-only stuff so bare minimum of boilerplate is present in the parser class
// (e.g. create your Hints.cfg exactly the way it's done here or face consequences).
// "class" should exactly match your classname; "group" can be anything. "general" and "multiselection" groups are shown automatically when appropriate.
// Supported tags are <b> for Bold and <br> for line break. Action name inside of <k> tag will insert keyboard shortcut for given action in bold.
// Only single-line comments are supported.

"<b>Left click</b> on a line to toggle the <b>'Shown as 1-sided on automap'</b> flag."

"Hold <b>Ctrl</b> to toggle the display of the lines that are not drawn, either because there was no height change (gray) or the <b>'Not shown on automap'</b> flag is set (light gray)."
