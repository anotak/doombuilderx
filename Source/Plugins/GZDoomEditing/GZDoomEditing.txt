Title:                  (G)ZDoom Editing Plugin

Author:                 Pascal vd Heiden

Plugin version:         0.0

Core version needed:    2.1.0.1394



Description
===========================================================================

This plugins adds features to help editing with the new features in the
ZDoom and GZDoom sourceports and those derived from these sourceports.

List of supported features in this plugin:
- Slopes
- 3D floors (also sloped)
- Colored sector lighting
- Light levels in sectors (also sloped)
- Flat scaling, rotation and offsets
- Texture scaling and offsets



Installation
===========================================================================

1) Place the GZDoomEditing.dll file in Doom Builder's "Plugins" directory.

2) Start Doom Builder and go to Tools menu, Preferences. Choose the
Controls tab and find the "GZDoom Visual Mode" action in the Modes group.
Set this action to a key you wish to use to switch into and out from
Visual Mode. You can give this the same key as your original mode, because
now we will replace the original Visual Mode with the new one.

3) Go to Tools menu, Game Configurations. Choose the game configuration on
which you wish to use the new Visual Mode. This plugin is made for UDMF
formats, but some features also work for Hexen format. Go to the Modes tab
and UNCHECK the original Visual Mode and CHECK the "GZDoom Visual Mode".

You can also have both Visual Modes together (simply do not uncheck the
original Visual Modein step 3) but you will need a different key for the
action that switches to the mode.



Usage
===========================================================================

I don't feel like writing this now. Figure it out yourself.
