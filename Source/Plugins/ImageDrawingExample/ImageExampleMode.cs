	// This class defines an classic editing mode. You can also inherit from VisualMode for a
	// visual editing mode or inherit from EditMode if you feel creative. The ClassicMode
	// provides basic 2D editing mode features such as zooming in/out and panning the view as
	// well as a bunch of usefull events.
	//
	
	//
	// This EditMode attribute allows you to link the editing mode into Doom Builder. The core
	// only sees your editing mode with this attribute and uses the settings to register it.
	//
	// DisplayName: This is the name you want to display to the user for this mode.
	//
	// SwitchAction: This is the action (see Actions.cfg) that engages this mode.
	//
	// ButtonImage: If set, creates a button on the toolbar for this mode and uses this image.
	//              Note that the image is included in this project as "Embedded Resource".
	//
	// ButtonOrder: Ordering number for the position of the button on the toolbar.
	//
	// ButtonGroup: Group in which to put the button on the toolbar.
	//              (Groups are buttons that are grouped together between separators)
	//
	// UseByDefault: THIS OPTION MAY BE INTRUSIVE TO THE USER, USE WITH GREAT CARE!
	//               Set this to enable this editing mode for use in all game configurations
	//               by default. This only applies the first time a plugin is loaded and can
	//               still be changed by the user. But it may not be desired and may conflict
	//               with other editing modes.
	//
	// Volatile: Set this to make this mode a volatile mode. When volatile, the mode is
	//           automatically cancelled when certain major actions are performed (such as
	//           when the map is saved)
