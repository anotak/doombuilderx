This describes the various compiler interfaces available. These can be used with
the "interface" setting in a compiler configuration. Plugins can create their
own interfaces by inheriting from the abstract Compiler class.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AccCompiler

This compiler interface is made for Acc compilers, but can be used for any compiler
which accepts a single script input file and writes a single output file.

If this interface detects a file named "acs.err" created by the compiler, it will
parse this file and treat the contents as compiler errors. In this case, the output
file contents are not copied into the wad file.

With this interface supports the following placeholders in command-line parameters:

%FI indicates the input path and filename (temporary location for compiler).

%FO indicates the output path and filename (temporary location for compiler).

%FS indicates the path and filename of the original file.

%PT indicates the temporary directory path where the compiler is located.

%PS indicates the path of the original file.

The 'original file' is the saved location of the WAD file when the script is an
internal lump. If the wad file is not saved, %PW is the same as %PT and %FS is the
path and filename of the temporary wad file.

These placeholders are case-sensitive!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NodesCompiler

This compiler interface is made for nodebuilders.

With this interface you can use the following command-line parameters:

%FI indicates the input filename (no path included).

%FO indicates the output filename (no path included).

When %FO is not specified, the nodebuilder should output to %FI
These placeholders are case-sensitive!
