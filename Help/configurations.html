		Doom Builder is a very flexible editor that can be customized for your own sourceport or mapping project. Most of the settings that are different among the sourceports are in configuration files. You can find these configurations in the subdirectories of your Doom Builder program directory. This part of the Reference Manual helps you writing your own configurations, but is only recommended for advanced users.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can safely create your own configurations for your mapping project or sourceport. If there are any errors in your configuration, Doom Builder will show these in the <a href="w_errorsandwarnings.html">Errors & Warnings dialog</a>. Doom Builder is installed with several configurations which can be great examples to see how these things work. It is recommended to always create new configurations in separate files. Do not modify the files that are installed by Doom Builder, as these will be overwritten when a new version is installed.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you made changes to the configurations in the Doom Builder subdirectories, you must restart Doom Builder to reload the configurations with your changes.
