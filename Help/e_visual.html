		The Visual Mode is different from the other modes. In this mode you can walk and fly through your map in 3D and see it as it would look like in game. With the crosshair you can aim at objects (floors, ceilings, walls and things) and edit them instantly. You can also select objects and perform actions on all objects together. Note that not all actions apply to an entire selection.
		
		<h2>Default Controls</h2>
		<table border="0" cellspacing="6" width="90%">
		<tr>
			<td width="150" valign="top"><b>W</b></td>
			<td>Switches from any classic editing mode to this mode and back to the previous mode.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b title="Left Mouse Button">LMB</b></td>
			<td>Select the targeted object. For walls, hold down this button to drag the texture offsets.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b title="Right Mouse Button">RMB</b></td>
			<td>Edit the targeted object's properties.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b title="Middle Mouse Button">MMB</b></td>
			<td>Pastes the copied texture image or flat image onto the target or selection.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b title="Control + Right Mouse Button">Control+RMB</b></td>
			<td>Opens the <a href="w_imagesbrowser.html">Image Browser</a> to select a new texture or flat for the targeted or selected object.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b title="Shift + Middle Mouse Button">Shift+MMB</b></td>
			<td>Flood-fills with the copied texture image or flat image onto the target. This fills all adjacent textures or flats that are identical to the original. Note that this action is only applied to the targeted object and does not work for a selection.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>C</b></td>
			<td>Clears the selection.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>E</b></td>
			<td>Move forward. Hold Shift to move faster.</td>
		</tr>

			<td valign="top"><b>D</b></td>
			<td>Move backward. Hold Shift to move faster.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>S</b></td>
			<td>Strafe left. Hold Shift to move faster.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>F</b></td>
			<td>Strafe right. Hold Shift to move faster.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>G</b></td>
