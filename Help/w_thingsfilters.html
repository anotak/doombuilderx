		With the Things Filters dialog window, you can set up your own Things filters that you can use to show only relevant things in the editor. You can access this dialog from the View menu. Select a filter on the left to edit it, or click on <b>New Filter</b> to create a new one. You can remove the selected filter by clicking on the <b>Delete Selected</b> button. On the right is the <b>Filter Settings</b> are where you can edit the selected filter.<br />
		<br />
		Enter the name of your filter in the <b>Name</b> field. If you want to show only Things from a specific category, select the category in the <b>Filter by category</b> box. Below that you can select the settings by which you want to filter the Things (<b>Filter by settings)</b>. A grayed/filled checkbox means it is not used for the filter. If the checkbox is empty, it means that the setting may not be set on the Things to pass the filter. If the checkbox is checked, it means that the setting must be set on the Things to pass the filter.<br />
