// NOTE: Nodebuilder configuration key names defined here must be unique for all nodebuilders!
// Recommend to start the key name with the name of the compiler, followed by underscore and a specific name.

// The "compiler" setting must refer to an existing compiler (such as defined above), but it
// does not have to be a compiler defined in the same configuration file.
