DoomBuilder X
based on code by anotak, CodeImp, MaxED, boris_i, ZZYZX
=======================================================
version 2.1.3.12
=====================
- new Lua plugin
- texture categories for subfolders/subwads inside pk3 resource archives
- bmsq added long texture name support. thanks bmsq!
- moved "Grid Increase" / "Grid Decrease" to be beside each other in the hotkey setup
- fixed a minor bug with displaying texture counts in the browser
- merged texture and flat browser source code to reduce code duplication (this shouldn't have any effects that are noticeable to you, but please, keep an eye for new bugs with the texture browser)
- minor tweaks to status bar flavor text
- made it so that the initial directory for the file dialog is separate based on whether it's wads, resources, or prefabs
- fixed a crash when double click editing sectors in make sectors mode

version 2.1.3.10
=====================
- fixed newly drawn geometry merging incorrectly in rare circumstances
- fixed inconsistent behavior when drawing new geometry counterclockwise to more resemble the DB2 behavior
- fixed some weirdnesses with the Map Options screen if you had the first game config selected (Boom by default)
- when you alt-tab back into the script editor, the keyboard focus goes to the text box as expected
- when you Save As, the filename is filled in already with the current one
- renamed UDMF/Hexen activation stuff relating to projectiles because it's more correct and less confusing
- fixed crash when creating a new level with no resources selected and randomized textures
- fixed a crash when going in 3d mode with no resources loaded
- fixed a potential threading error with unknown images
- crossported one of MaxED's optimization to drawing new geometry from gzdb
- hide matching texture sets with 0 textures in the texture browser
- additional logging for shader loading crashes

version 2.1.3.8
=====================
- fixed a bug with setting back sidedefs in the linedef edit window
- update to ACC 1.56
- fixed inconsistency with linedef info panel
- fixed heretic hanging moss things not hanging in 3d mode
- improved logging information
- cleanup for a bunch of compilation warnings left over from DB2 (should hopefully help prevent future bugs). some of this is based on MaxED's GZDoomBuilder code. may slightly improve performance.

version 2.1.3.6
=====================
- optional feature: instead of displaying the logo on startup, a tip or a hopefully helpful quote about mapping is displayed. you can disable this in the Tools -> Preferences -> Interface tab. if i quoted you and you want the quote removed (for any reason, no questions asked), feel free to contact me and i'll make sure to remove it in the next version.
- new hotkey for swapping upper/lower textures in classic 2d linedef mode. you have to set the hotkey yourself in the menu
- added flat scaling/rotation/panning stuff to EE-UDMF config for Edit Sector window
- fixed "upper/lower" being cut off sometimes in the linedef info panel if you had both checked.
- fixed a crash on changing map settings

version 2.1.3.4
=====================
- big optimizations to drawing new geometry, brand new algorithms for detecting inner sectors as well as splitting lines by vertices. please let me know if there are any issues.
- added editor for map-level udmf fields outside of blocks. loading/saving preserve any map level udmf properties (for forward compatibility with future UDMF stuff). (see Edit -> Map UDMF info...)
- renamed "Deaf" to "Ambush", as it's more correct and matches the Doom source code itself.
- new hotkey for incrementing/decrementing tag of currently selected element in classic 2d modes. you have to set the hotkey yourself in the menu
- fixed linedef special information being blank in the info panel sometimes
- fixed longstanding DB2 crash related to make sectors + undo/redo
- fixed longstanding DB2 bug where vertices would not merge correctly under some circumstances
- Disabled ally/strifeally from the udmf configs as it does the same thing as friendly. you can still set it manually using the UDMF window.
- fixed a serious performance issue on maps with a lot of geometry (for example, vela pax map01)
- fixed a crash loading malformed patches & sprites (for example, daedalus.wad)
- minor tweaks to logging system

version 2.1.3.3
=====================
- fixed bug in 2.1.3.2 with linedef/thing edit windows, please upgrade
- including zokumbsp-1.0.10-beta4. Doom 1/2 configs have zokumbsp extensions listed under linedef specials now. You need to build your map with zokumbsp to use them. There's chance they won't work with anything other than vanilla/chocolate, so be aware!
- optimized sector label positioning algorithm, should have speedups on initial map load and whenever you do anything that changes geometry
- fix for slow loading of maps that use a lot of sidedef compression

version 2.1.3.2
=====================
- linedef / thing / sector edit windows partially loaded when you open a map. vertex one loads first time you open it. once loaded all these should open about 50-70ms faster, in case of individual objects selected it should open in 4-8ms.
- change some window scaling stuff
- fixed plugins issue from 2.1.3.1 (sorry)
- minor bugfixes

version 2.1.3.1
=====================
- fix for issue with Thing/Sector/Linedef/Vertex Edit Windows on smaller resolutions
- fix issue w resizing thing edit window

version 2.1.3.0
=====================
- new config file named builderx.cfg located in the %LOCALAPPDATA%\Doom Builder folder. it will attempt to copy your old builder.cfg on the first launch if the new file is missing.
- fixed choppiness in 3d mode if computer has been on too long
- you can set your own default textures, and even have them randomize on New Map. default textures changed to CRATOP1 / CRATE1 / CRATOP2
- a basic EE-UDMF config partially based on the GZDB-BF one (thanks Altazimuth, Maxed, Printz, Zzyzx). on mouseover highlights portals like line/sector tags, and includes the new sector scroller properties.
- hold alt while drawing geometry for "pen mode" (try it and you'll see)
- new hotkey added to allow you to test your map with a player start at the mouse cursor (you need to assign it in preferences) 
- some minor stuff to allow some gzdb plugin cross-compatibility (Sound Propagation, sound environ, automap). this is unstable, use at your own risk. some gzdb features are "faked" to the plugins to trick them into running
- fixed one of the issues that causes it so that you cant click in 3d mode sometimes. lmk if this persists
- not really a change, but just in case it's unclear, the GZDoom Editing plugin that can render slopes and 3d floors is included. may need setup in preferences
- added autogenerated "flats" & "textures" categories if you load in a config that can mix flats/textures
- missing textures are drawn with full brightness in 3d visual mode
- scripts editor opens SCRIPTS tab by default instead of DIALOGUE
- linedef edit window resizeable, shifted around a little so UDMF stuff doesn't require scrolling on default size
- sector/line/thing action special selection dropdown is larger. less scrolling
- action special selection window resizeable, is larger by default. less scrolling
- thing edit window resizeable, taller by default (equal to default linedef edit window height). less scrolling
- sector edit window resizeable
- vertex edit window resizeable, does not show up in taskbar (matching behavior of other windows)
- statusbar 18 pix shorter (less wasted space)
- map format selection dropdown taller, to not require scrolling
- error log does not show up in taskbar (matching behavior of other windows)
- on the error log window, the "close" button is highlighted by default, letting you close it by hitting enter
- texture browser opens faster, and draws faster for smoother scrolling. mild tradeoff: currently selected item is shown with a solid background, instead of a gradient
- texture categorization much faster (~3500% speedup on my machine). should be noticeably faster to open a level or to reload resources
- flats in texture browser have a * after
- curve linedefs window has a "snap to grid" option. careful about this, sometimes the grid makes it not-so-curvy
- Allow Eternity .pke files to be used as resources (thanks to Altazimuth)
- zip operations are done using sharpcompress instead of sharpzip. pk3/pke loading is wayyy faster. improvements in undo/prefab speeds too. uses some code from MaxED's gzdb
- distant stuff in 3d visual mode is no longer obscured by fog. objects beyond the draw distance will "pop in", which may be mildly uglier, but more functional, as you get more draw distance with the same perfomance this way.
- new-map dialogue window filled in with "MAP01" by default
- configuration parser is faster -> program startup is faster
- remood, doom legacy, and jdoom cfgs disabled (less clutter, improves loading times). to re-enable them, move them from '\Configurations\old' to '\Configurations'.
- saving wad files with lumps in them unrelated to the current map should be around ~twice as fast
- logging is moved into its own thread, improving performance. should particularly help ppl with slower hard drives.
- significant speedups when drawing new geometry with a lot of vertices
- other misc performance improvements
- i've been having some issues compiling the visplane explorer plugin, so that isn't included for now :/
- newer version of zdoom ACC included
- fixed several crashes
- support for default values for some types of arguments to lines in game cfg files. same syntax as gzdb
- new game cfg linedef action setting "highlightmatchinglineid", used for EE-UDMF type 301 Line_QuickPortal
- changed titlebar text
- zokumbsp included
- removed reject editor plugin because it's been causing crashes :/
- more explicit error if there are no plugins found
- removed system.xml and trackbar dependencies
- new error / crashlog handler
- actions can disregard the alt key (don't worry about it if you don't get it)

also included are these commits to the SVN version that aren't in the build on the db2 site, these are by codeimp and boris_i
- Added Reject Editor plugin
- Upgraded project files to Visual Studio 2013
- Removed some unused code from UniversalMapSetIO
- Added plugin event OnMapNodesRebuilt which allows plugins to read/modify nodebuilder output.
- Added RebuildNodes method in MapManager which allows plugins to rebuild the nodes on demand.
@ Added NodesViewer source code
- The "Skulltag" sourceport renamed, so changed description to "Zandronium" [sic]. We can't change the filenames without giving everyone double configurations when they download an update.
- Stuck thing error checker now also regards thing flags, For more Information see [anotak edit: link removed bc the doom builder forums are gone]
- Find and Replace Mode: can now find things by their flags
- Set a proper title for the linedef flags form
- Find and Replace Mode: can now find linedefs by their flags
- @Fixed VisplaneExplorer plugin output path
- @Changed platform of VisplaneExplorer plugin from Any CPU to x86 so that it can be compiled with MSBuild
- Better timing clock without accuracy loss after long system uptime (should solve camera movement lag issues) [ANOTAK EDIT: this wasnt quite working right in that version, but it should be fixed]
- Fixed hanging things position in GZDoom Visual Mode.
- Improved stuck thing error checker: now takes vertical position of things into account (where applicable)
- Improved Hexen configuration: defined several thing properties more precisely
- Improved Heretic configuration: defined several thing properties more precisely
