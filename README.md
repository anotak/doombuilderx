# Doom Builder X

Doom Builder X is a Doom 2 map editor. Doom Builder X is a fork of CodeImp's [Doom Builder 2](http://www.doombuilder.com/), mainly focused on long term maintenence, bugfixes, and improved responsiveness where possible.

See the [releases](https://github.com/anotak/doombuilderx/releases) page for downloads.

### Prerequisites for running

if you already have DB2 or GZDB working, you already have these:

[.NET 3.5](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21) - (You should have this already if you have Windows 7 or newer)  
and  
[DirectX 9.0c Runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35) - (This is not included in DirectX10 or 11)
and  
SlimDX - The SlimDX website is down permanently, but the 32-bit SlimDX runtime installer (slimdx.msi) is present in the Setup folder.  

### Supported systems

DBX is 32-bit, and supports Windows XP or newer. The hardware requirements are lower than that of Doom Builder 2, if you are familiar with that.

We do not currently directly support Linux or Mac, but ideally I'd like to do so eventually. The way SlimDX was used in DB2 makes that project very difficult, unfortunately. Although, [some people have found a workaround with WINE that may work on some systems](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/106271-gzdoombuilder-wine-tutorial/). Several well-known mappers use a Windows XP VM to run DBX on Linux or Mac as well.

### Compiling

Nuget in Visual Studio should handle getting SlimDX, SharpCompress, and Moonsharp. You need to install the SlimDX runtime in the Setup folder as well, which is present in the Data/Setup/ folder.  
The RejectEditor and VisplaneExplorer projects should not be built. They were broken when I first got them from the Doom Builder 2 SVN and I have not had time to determine the cause.  
The Builder40 project is the same as the Builder project, just on .NET 4.0. Builder is what I release, but sometimes Builder40 is useful, as Visual Studio's debugging and profiling tools support .NET 4.0 much better. However, compiling Builder40 is completely optional.
